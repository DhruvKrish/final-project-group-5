# Week 1 Summary
<strong>Activities in the past week:</strong> We all together worked on drafting the project proposal. Prior to it, we had a brief session of 2 hours where each one of use convinced one other what we plan to do for this research project. Finally, we created the first draft shortly after this meeting. Upon proofreading, we were unhappy with a couple of paragraphs and then fixed them until we were satisfied.
We created a board on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/jXv54U3m/ecs-251-project) to structure our planning. Also, joined the [GitHub](https://github.com/ECS-251-W2020/final-project-group-5) project group for ECS 251.

<strong>Activities planned for this week:</strong> On Thursday, Feb 13, we plan to discuss the paper with our advisor and our research group to identify gaps amongst our understanding and rectify them immediately. Next, we will work to decompose our week 1 problem (i.e. improving the performance of Resilient DBâ€™s PBFT so as to accommodate the cross sharding protocol) into smaller problems so that we can individually work on different components.

<strong>Issues:</strong> We already have our own GitHub repo for [ResilientDB](https://github.com/resilientdb/resilientdb), is it mandatory to use the one provided in the last announcement?
