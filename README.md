<strong>Abstract</strong>\
Fault tolerance and scalability are the two major limitations of most distributed systems. In this project, we intend to show that sharding is a prominent solution to these limitations in distributed transaction processing, specifically for permissioned blockchain systems. We would achieve this by implementing a sharding protocol called AHL (Attested HyperLedger) in ResilientDB. AHL makes use of Trusted Execution Environment to improve fault-tolerance and sharding to enhance performance and scalability. ResilientDB is a high-throughput yielding permissioned blockchain system. Our ultimate aim is to show improvements in fault-tolerance and scalability of ResilientDB by implementing AHL.
